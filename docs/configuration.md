# Configuration

Configuration is done in multiple files in the `settings` folder. You should never touch the `settings.template` folder in normal use.

## General

`charjabox_general.yml` includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc.

## Application Settings

Every application has it's own settings file, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration.
