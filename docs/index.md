Work in progress Ansible based Homeserver setup using Docker.

Inspired by [Ansible NAS](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) and [HomelabOS](https://gitlab.com/NickBusey/HomelabOS)

**What is this?**

In the future this maybe could be a simple solution to quickly deploy a homeserver using Ansible and Docker.
At the moment it can share files via SMB and create a Portainer container for managing Docker containers. But this is only the beginning.
I will add more information, documentation and features soon

**Features**

* Samba Sharing
* Manual container management using Portainer
* Home Media Streaming with Plex or Jellyfin
* Your own wiki using Dokuwiki
* macOS backups over the network with Timemachine over SMB
* Personal Finance management with Firefly III
* Local DNS management with BIND
* Hosting your own git repositories
* Download caching for many CDNs
