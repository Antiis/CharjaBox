# Bazarr
[Bazarr](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr) - Companion application to Sonarr and Radarr for downloading subtitles

Bazarr uses the paths set in `charjabox_tv_directory` and `charjabox_movies_directory` in `charjabox_general.yml` to access your TV and movie collections.

The subtitles get downloaded to the same directory as your media files.
