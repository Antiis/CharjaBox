# Portainer
[Portainer](https://portainer.io/) - Web Interface for managing Docker containers

You can use Portainer to get a simple overview over your running containers, to access logs and container shells and more, without needing a terminal.

After enabling Portainer, go to the webinterface (by default the port is 9000) and create your admin user. Then choose `local` as an endpoint to manage your local docker install.
