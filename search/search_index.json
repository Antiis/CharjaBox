By default the directory settings/charjabox/ is used if you don't specify a different path. You should never touch the settings/defaults/ folder in normal use. You only need to add the settings that you actually change to your settings folder. If you do this by copying the whole files over from settings/defaults/ or by creating your own files with just the variables you need is up to you. Every file ending in .yml inside of settings/$YOURSETTINGS will be recognized by CharjaBox. If you use CharjaBox to set up multiple servers, you can use different settings folders for every server. To do this, set different hostnames or groups for your different servers in your Inventory and create host_vars/$HOSTNAME or group_vars/$GROUPNAME files for each server/group. In those files you can change the charjabox_settings_path variable and set your settings in a folder inside of settings/ with the same name as the variable. General charjabox_general.yml includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc. charjabox_ports.yml includes all the ports for the applications in one place. Application Settings Every application has it's own settings file, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration. Example I have a local server currently running Portainer, Heimdall, Nginx and Plex. I called the group production to differentiate it from a testing server.
