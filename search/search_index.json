By default the directory settings/charjabox/ is used if you don't specify a different path. You should never touch the settings/defaults/ folder in normal use. You only need to add the settings that you actually change to your settings folder. If you do this by copying the whole files over from settings/defaults/ or by creating your own files with just the variables you need is up to you. Every file ending in .yml inside of settings/$YOURSETTINGS will be recognized by CharjaBox. If you use CharjaBox to set up multiple servers, you can use different settings folders for every server. To do this, set different hostnames or groups for your different servers in your Inventory and create host_vars/$HOSTNAME or group_vars/$GROUPNAME files for each server/group. In those files you can change the charjabox_settings_path variable and set your settings in a folder inside of settings/ with the same name as the variable. General charjabox_general.yml includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc. charjabox_ports.yml includes all the ports for the applications in one place. Application Settings Every application has it's own settings file, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration. Example I have a local server currently running Portainer, Heimdall, Nginx and Plex. I called the group production to differentiate it from a testing server. The inventory file looks like this: [production] 192.168.1.22 [testing] 192.168.1.33 [someothergroup] 192.168.1.42 The group name production tells Ansible to look for the file group_vars/production.yml , which looks like this: charjabox_settings_path: \"production\" This variable tells the playbook to look for custom variables in settings/production , where I have the following files containing custom settings: charjabox_general.yml heimdall.yml nginx.yml plex.yml portainer.yml","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#configuration","text":"Configuration is done in multiple files in a group-specific subfolder of the settings folder.

To automatically add your server to your account, generate a claim token here and insert that token into the plex_token variable. Please note that the claim token expires after 5 minutes, so generate it right before running the playbook. After the server is set up you can visit the Plex webinterface via the official Plex website or port 32400 on your server. Changing the port for Plex can lead to some difficulties with the apps, so it is not encouraged to do that. Once you are on the webinterface, you can do your first time setup and let Plex scan through your media files.","title":"General"},{"location":"applications/plex/#variables","text":"Variable Type Default Comment plex_enabled Boolean false Enable/Disable the application plex_config_directory String \"{{ docker_home }}/plex/config\" Path were application config should be stored plex_music_directory String \"{{ charjabox_music_directory }}\" Path were music is stored plex_tv_directory String \"{{ charjabox_tv_directory }}\" Path were TV shows are stored plex_movies_directory String \"{{ charjabox_movies_directory }}\" Path were movies are stored plex_token String \"\" Plex claim token plex_traefik_enabled Boolean false Enable/Disable access to application via Traefik plex_domain String \"plex.{{ charjabox_domain }}\" Domain used to access the application plex_web_port Int 32400 Port used to access the application","title":"Variables"},{"location":"applications/portainer/","text":"General Portainer - Web Interface for managing Docker containers You can use Portainer to get a simple overview over your running containers, to access logs and container shells and more, without needing a terminal.
