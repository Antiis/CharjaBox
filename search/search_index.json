Do not change files in this folder, as it is tracked by git. To do this, create variable files (or folders) in either group_vars/ or host_vars . These can either be files called $GROUPNAME.yml / $HOSTNAME.yml or folders called $GROUPNAME / $HOSTNAME with any number of .yml files inside. Then, overwrite variables in the form of $VARIABLE: $VALUE . If you use CharjaBox to set up multiple servers, you can use different settings for every server, by having multiple groups and/or hosts with different variables in your inventory. General charjabox_general.yml includes all general configuration about your server, like Hostnames, Timezones, etc. charjabox_ports.yml includes all the ports for the applications in one place. Application Settings Every application has it's own variables, where you can enable the Application and apply App-specific configuration. Customizing the Docker containers For everything that is not covered by existing variables, there is the option to add additional port bindings, volumes, environment variables and labels to Docker containers. Only use this function if you understand how Docker and docker-compose work. Those additional values are set in list variables with the following names: $appName_additional_env: [] $appName_additional_labels: [] $appName_additional_ports: [] $appName_additional_volumes: [] Just exchange $appName with the internal name of the app (see the prefix of other variables for that name) and add the lines, just as you would add them to the docker-compose file, as a list of strings.
