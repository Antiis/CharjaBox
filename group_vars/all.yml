charjabox_settings_path: "charjabox"

# Do not edit this file. All other files in either group_vars/ or host_vars/ are covered by .gitignore. 
# So if you want to change the settings path, create a vars file that fits the hostname or group set for your server in the inventory file.
# Please use a path that fits the pattern "*_settings", because those are ignored by git.
